# Face Mask Detection

Pandemic situation is something which no one could for see. This situation has compelled us to take few necessary precautions to keep everyone safe. In which wearing mask is really important not only for individual’s safety but also people around us. However, there are situations in which people tend to ignore the severity of the situation and ignore the precautions which can be dreadful not only for them but people around them. It’s not feasible to manually keep a track of people who aren’t wearing mask. People are constantly overhauling their existing infrastructure and processes to be more efficient, safe, and usable for employees, customers, and the community. With the ongoing pandemic, it’s even more important to have advanced analytics approach and services in place to mitigate risk. For public safety and health, authorities are recommending the use of face masks and coverings to control the spread of COVID-19. So, having an application which could detect the people who aren’t wearing mask or improperly wearing the mask will be really useful to ensure safety of an environment. It deals with using AI network on a stream of video to detect people without mask using opencv and other libraries.
